    <p>heya. this is my site. it has some cool things you could check out i guess. it's still a work in progress but you can check out the links at the top to find some information about this site.</p>
    <p>i've moved to a new domain owned by dominick which is what i'll be hosting my site on from now on. neocities was still kind of limited to me and i wanted to do more which is why i'm hosting on another domain. i'll still be keeping my neocities site up for archival purposes, but this will be the site i will be updating from now on.</p>
