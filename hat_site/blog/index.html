    <h2>lack of ideas - Monday, December 9 2019</h2>
    <p>i really don't know what else to add to this site. i'm just intending it to be my personal place with just a few things instead of a giant mess of random pages like how my older neocities site was.</p>
    <p>i figured to make an another section of the site to upload my big mess on, which wont be accessible through the sites normal navigation but rather just typing it in manually. too bad there isn't a feature to download your site on neocities anymore! which is why i'm not able to just transfer my old site onto this domain. but anyways, it's better to just put my old site stay where it is, so yeah</p>

    <p>there's a pretty annoying problem that can get worse as i make more pages on this site. as i know, this site is done manually by hand. making more pages means that i have to link them through the site's navigation bar and update each page that exists on the site manually, such as every note in the notebook.</p>
    <p>but there is a solution for this. not a good solution but it's just to add a "more" link to the navigation bar. that's it. nothing else.</p>
    <p>i discovered the solution while making this article. so, yeah. i might add a "more" link later.</p>

    <p>yes, the site has been redesigned to not look like some garbage 90s site. looks way better now with a refresh. i will be keeping up the old site though for archival purposes. do not worry.</p>
