    <p>9:29 pm tuesday, october 2, 2018, note 5</p>
    <p>another good old note thrown in the rubbish bin.</p>
    <p>ugahgalo, gaiabaerarasoaish eawes coansiwesreadewad aewy lepaoeuaganaquageaausaa. TRANSLATED IN ENGLISH - gibberish also is considered a language too.</p>
    <a href="https://hatto.neocities.org/notebook/gibberish.png"><p>heres why.</p></a>
    <p>only gibberish people will understand this, right? well I have not learned that much gibberish yet, so therefore I do not know what this conversation is saying, if I learn gibberish in the future, I will understand what this means, so we will be able to reveal the secret in this conversation if I know what they are saying, okay?</p>
    <p>after writing this, it's 9:38 pm now. wow time really goes fast.</p>
