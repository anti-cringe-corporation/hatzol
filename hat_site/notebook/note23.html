    <p>everyone should archive this website on the wayback machine</p>
    <p>i'm like the only person that's actually doing that, so if you wanna help archive a tiny piece of history of my site on the internet, don't forget to do that.</p>
    <p>also something nice is that my site affects the wayback machine's css, so saving a page will make the saving screen turn into basic text.</p>
